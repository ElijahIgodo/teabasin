<article class="article">

<p>There are many reasons why women would like to get pregnant quickly. Sometimes they can be related to age, or because you want to have children with little age difference, or because many couples cannot spend much time together due to professional commitments and are forced to plan conception more carefully.
</p>  
<h4>Quick conception is not impossible, but it does require some practical planning.
</h4>    
<p>Doctors recommend having fertility tests when a couple fails to conceive after 12 months of trying. However, some couples decide not to wait that long.
</p>    
<p>You do what you feel! Often to get pregnant quickly it is enough to simply adjust the timing of sexual intercourse to coincide with the days of the woman’s peak fertility.
</p>    
<h3>Here are some helpful tips to conceive faster!</h3>  
<p>First take care of yourself. It may sound trivial, but it is an often overlooked strategy. Pay attention to your health and well-being in general. Overworking, skipping meals, and not getting enough rest or sleep all contribute to increased stress levels, which can impair ovulation.
</p>    
<p>Make sure you and your partner are within an ideal weight range. Being overweight or obese does not favour the chances of getting pregnant, as does being underweight.
</p>    
<p>Plan for regular sexual intercourse. Undoubtedly, this is the most effective method of getting pregnant. Irregular, infrequent or sporadic sexual intercourse reduce the chances of conception. Try to have sex every 2-3 days (or nights) to increase your chances.
</p>    
<p>Remember that if you have taken the contraceptive pill, it will take a few months for your ovulation cycles to become regular again.
</p>    
<p>Keep an open mind and don’t be too rigid in everyday life. You may need to review your sexual intercourse schedule based on when you are most fertile. You can’t plan everything and spontaneity is an important element in getting pregnant quickly.
</p>    
<p>Try to have sex when you are about to ovulate, not after. The sperm can survive for up to five days after leaving the man’s body, while the egg must theoretically be fertilized within 12-24 hours after ovulation. Perhaps you might find it helpful to chart your ovulation so you can track your cycle.
</p>    
<p>Try to relax! If sexual intercourse becomes a commitment and only a means to an end, it will no longer be pleasant for you or your partner. Maintain objectivity and a sense of humor. Conception can take months, hold on!
</p>    
  <img class="thumbnails" src="health-and-fitness/images/smoke-alcohol.jpg" alt="Smoking">
<p>Do not smoke and do not take illicit substances. Excess alcohol, caffeine, or over-the-counter medications can also impact pregnancy timing. If you are taking any medications prescribed by your doctor, consult your doctor to find out if you need to stop or if you can continue taking them safely.
</p>    
<p>Read the article on the best positions to get pregnant . It is packed with interesting information and tips to aid conception.
</p>    
<p>Don’t rush to stand up after sex. Lying on your back for about 30 minutes can have some benefits. Whether it contributes to conception by helping seminal fluid stay in the vagina longer is a matter of debate. But it’s still harmless.
</p>    
<p>If possible, choose to have sex in the morning. According to some research, sperm levels are slightly higher in the morning than in the evening or at other times of the day.
</p>    
<p>Do not use saliva or water as a lubricant, as both can impair sperm counts.
</p>    
<h3>And what can my partner do to help me get pregnant quickly?</h3>  
<p>Make sure your diet is healthy. Zinc is an important nutrient that contributes to healthy sperm function. Therefore, regularly include fish, green leafy vegetables, eggs, fruit and grains in your diet.
</p>    
<p>It is important that the partner does not let the testicles overheat. Wearing tight panties and pants, taking hot baths, or staying in a spa will compromise the amount of sperm produced. The testicles are in that position because they need to be kept at a cooler temperature than the rest of the body. If you really want to get pregnant quickly, suggest that she wear boxers instead of panties.
</p>    
<p>Suggest that your partner save semen for sexual intercourse. Restoring sperm levels after ejaculation takes time, so masturbating or having intercourse several times a day is not believed to favor the chances of conception.
</p>    
<h3>Other tips to get pregnant quickly:</h3>  
<p>In addition to the physical aspects related to conception, it is also useful to reflect on the emotional side of the relationship. Mutual consideration promotes a healthy and regular sex life. If you feel that interest in the couple is waning, try doing something different. It is very easy to let the goal of pregnancy overshadow everything else. Go, enjoy a different scenery and be adventurous. Many couples associate successful childbirth with a break in their daily routines.
</p>    
<p>Some couples report that positive visualization is helpful in conceiving. Imagining yourself with the baby and creating positive and welcoming vibes is harmless.
</p>    
<p>If you don’t feel like it, don’t feel like you need to tell the world you’re trying to have a baby so you don’t feel under the spotlight or under pressure.
</p>    
<p>Don’t see sexual intercourse only as a means to an end, have fun and enjoy your moments!
